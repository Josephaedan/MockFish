# MockFish - A Reinforcement Learning Project for the King and Queen Endgame

## Introduction

Inspired by the achievements of top Chess AI bots using Deep reinforcement learning, this report aims to delve into the application of reinforcement learning by developing MockFish, a chess model aptly named after leading Chess AI StockFish, to develop an algorithm to checkmate the opposing King in the King and Queen endgame, a subset of Chess games.

This project is developed by Joseph Aedan Marcus as an assignment for the COM3240 Artificial Intelligence module at the University of Sheffield.
